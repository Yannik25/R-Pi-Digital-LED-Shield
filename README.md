# R-Pi-Digital-LED-Shield

Created with KiCad

Main purpose for me was to use this board with my 3D Printer with [OctoPrint](https://octoprint.org) and this add-on: [ws281x-led-status](https://cp2004.gitbook.io/ws281x-led-status/) but will also work with: [rpi_ws281x](https://github.com/jgarff/rpi_ws281x) and similar Software.

## Current status: Designed 
 
## Features
- Power R-Pi through DC Jack or screw terminal (over and reverse voltage Protection)
- Onboard Digital LED
	- can be skipped by bridging the solderpoints at JP1
- Level Shifter from 3.3V to 5V
